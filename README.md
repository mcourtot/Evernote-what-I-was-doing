# Evernote-what-I-was-doing
A simple apple script that let you log in an Evernote note what you're doing at the moment

Download this repository to actually make it work! :-)

# Setup
In order to make this small script to work, you will need a *Journals* notebook somewhere in your evernote as well as a note in there called *What I am doing*

# Run the script
To run the script, go into the directory where the script was installed and run:
```bash
osascript ./evernote_new_task_entry.applescript
```
# Expected output
This will open a new popup window, inviting user to enter a short one line description of their current activities.

Once saved this will create a new line in the *What am I doing* note in *Journals*.
